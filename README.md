### Hello! 🖖
- Talking about this post, I have to say that it doesn't contain a handler as I used the DJS-Commander from notunderctrl videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmuPOimscPs).
- Rest of the code is all made by me and written so anyone can used it.

### Packages📂

- Discord.js 🤖
> npm i discord.js
- .env 🔒
> npm i dotenv
- mongo 🍃
> npm i mongoose

- Save fill and make bot online 💂‍♂️
